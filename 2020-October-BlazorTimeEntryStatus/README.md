  Over the past few weeks, I've been digging into WebAssembly from a C# perspective for an article that I'm writing. Although I've been following a number of WebAssembly related C# technologies like mono, the Uno Platform, and Blazor, I felt that I'd get more out of my learning by building something.

  Fortunately, Dovico recently gave me some spare time to research into anything that interested me, so I decided to use that time to dig into Blazor by rewriting a small Java application that I built in 2011.

  This repository holds the code for the following article that walks you through creating the Dovico Time Entry Status app using Blazor WebAssembly: [https://cggallant.blogspot.com/2020/10/blazor-webassembly-and-dovico-time.html](https://cggallant.blogspot.com/2020/10/blazor-webassembly-and-dovico-time.html)
